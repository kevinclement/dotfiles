# Kevin's Dotfiles

Last updated when setting up Macbook Pro 2016, Sierra 10.12.2, 08/13/2017.

## What Is This?

This repository is used to setup a new mac.  Automation allows me not to worry about it later and other devs on my team can borrow for a similar setup.

## A Fresh macOS Setup

Follow these install instructions to setup a new Mac.

1. Download zip file from GitHub or clone into ~/.dotfiles
2. Run ./install.sh
3. Log into iCloud by hand
4. Restart and you're golden

Your Mac is now ready to use!
